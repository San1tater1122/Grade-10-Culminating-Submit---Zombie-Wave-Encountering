# Game Tutorial: Key Description
### Enter the game
Click the mouse button to enter the game and select the difficulty

### In the game
When the game starts, the game defaults to the fact that you are not holding a weapon. 
So you need to press 1 to take out the sword or press 2 to take out the crossbow.
Depending on the weapon you are using, the left click can swing a sword or shoot arrows.

- Important Tip: You need to swing the sword with intervals. If the interval is too short, it will be judged as a light strike, causing very little damage or no damage at all.

### Game victory or defeat
Follow the on-screen instructions and press the space key to return to the main game interface.
